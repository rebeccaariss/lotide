// FUNCTION IMPLEMENTATION
// allItems: an array of strings that we need to look through
// itemsToCount: an object specifying what to count
const countOnly = function(allItems, itemsToCount) {
  // check object key

  // if value === true, we should check how many instances of this [key?] there are in the array (allItems)

  // create and return a new object containing the [keys?] that were to be counted and how many instances of that key were found in the array


};
